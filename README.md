# Cryptographic Toolchain

This is a collection of simple (non-hardened) implementations of cryptographic algorithms and tools to do some basic cryptoanalysis.

Some of the packages provides a command line interface.
Pass `-h` to get more information using a package implementing a cli.

## Unittests

Some packages provide a unittest coverage, at least for some very simple test vectors.
These tests can be run with: `$ python3 -m unittest the_module.py`.
